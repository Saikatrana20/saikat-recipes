                <ol>
                    <li><span>Prepare Sugar Syrup (Chashni):</span> </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a saucepan, combine sugar and water.</li>
                        <li>Bring it to a boil, stirring continuously until the sugar dissolves completely.</li>
                        <li>Add saffron strands (if using) and cardamom powder.</li>
                        <li>Simmer for 5-6 minutes until the syrup slightly thickens.</li>
                        <li>Turn off the heat and add rose water or rose essence. Stir well and set aside.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li><span>Prepare Gulab Jamun Balls:</span> </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda.</li>
                        <li>Add ghee or unsalted butter and mix well with your fingers until the mixture resembles
                            breadcrumbs.</li>
                        <li>Gradually add milk and knead the mixture into a soft dough. The dough should be smooth and
                            not sticky.</li>
                        <li>If the dough is too dry, add a little more milk. If it's too sticky, add a bit more milk
                            powder.</li>
                        <li>Divide the dough into small equal-sized portions and shape them into smooth balls without
                            any cracks. Make sure there are no cracks on the surface; otherwise, they might break while
                            frying.</li>
                        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan over medium-low heat.</li>
                        <li>Once the oil is hot, carefully slide in the prepared dough balls, a few at a time, without
                            overcrowding the pan.</li>
                        <li>Fry the balls on low to medium-low heat, stirring gently and occasionally, until they turn
                            golden brown from all sides. This will take about 8-10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Remove the fried Gulab Jamun balls using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil by placing
                            them on a paper towel.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li><span>Soak Gulab Jamun in Sugar Syrup:</span> </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While the Gulab Jamun balls are still warm, gently drop them into the warm sugar syrup
                            (Chashni).</li>
                        <li>Allow the Gulab Jamun balls to soak in the sugar syrup for at least 1-2 hours before
                            serving. This helps them absorb the syrup and become soft and juicy.</li>
                        <li>Serve Gulab Jamun warm or at room temperature. They taste best when served fresh.</li>
                    </ul>
